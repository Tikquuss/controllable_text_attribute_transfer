1317,this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !,1
1318,needless to say we were shocked .,1
1319,i was told because the neighborhood is bad .,1
1320,the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .,1
1321,not worth it to me .,1
1322,the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .,1
1323,as a female i am personally offended by this place .,1
1324,stop by for a beer sat .,1
1325,they are charging _num_ a bottle .,1
1326,i wo n't be stopping there again .,1
1327,some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .,1
1328,should n't have wasted our time .,1
1329,walked in and no hello from the bartender .,1
1330,"no , we are locals .",1
1331,she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .,1
1332,"stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .",1
1333,what a disappointment .,1
1334,"it sure was quick , but , come on !",1
1335,this was not good .,1
1336,"maybe it was a bad day , but .",1
1337,first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .,1
1338,all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .,1
1339,at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .,1
1340,i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .,1
1341,i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .,1
1342,"however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .",1
1343,( which the soda was flat ) .,1
1344,i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .,1
1345,i literally could n't believe what had happened .,1
1346,i am never going to this one again .,1
1347,that is n't cool .,1
1348,not satisfied at all .,1

1352,i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .,1
1353,"bad business decision , in my opinion .",1

1365,"anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .",1
1366,"pretty sad , really .",1
1367,not so much .,1
1368,it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .,1
1369,then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !,1
1370,it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .,1
1371,i left my purchases there along with another customer .,1
1372,then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .,1
1373,i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .,1
1374,"no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .",1
1375,ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .,1
1376,save your money and do n't buy a warranty !,1
1377,i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .,1
1378,the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .,1
1379,i never got a call and a repair was never made .,1
1380,this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .,1
1381,the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !,1
1382,i have never been so disappointed !,1
1383,the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .,1

1386,pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .,1
1387,this one is trashy !,1

1398,absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .,1
1399,this place seriously needs more tellers .,1

1408,i said i only use apple .,1
1409,the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .,1
1410,i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .,1
1411,that was _num_ weeks ago .,1
1412,a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .,1
1413,and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .,1
1414,`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .,1
1415,very limited selection of everything .,1
1416,they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .,1
1417,no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .,1
1418,"the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .",1
1419,stay as far away from this place as possible .,1
1420,big huge mistake .,1
1421,i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .,1
1422,both looked grossed as hell .,1
1423,"this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .",1
1424,i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .,1
1425,"will never , ever visit this establishment again !",1
1426,the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .,1
1427,had n't been to this place in _num_ years .,1

1437,"i wanted to like it , i really did .",1
1438,i was very disappointed .,1
1439,the rest of the food items were just gross .,1
1440,there is trash and food all over it .,1
1441,"not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .",1
1442,"still , gross !",1
1443,"that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .",1
1444,just went back this weekend .,1
1445,not as good as 1st few times .,1
1446,the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .,1
1447,"when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .",1
1448,my family of _num_ will not be returning .,1
1449,she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .,1
1450,which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .,1
1451,again in a super loud voice we were told no .,1
1452,myself and my family will not be returning to the place .,1
1453,surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .,1
1454,service was a bit slow and not that friendly .,1
1455,our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .,1
1456,i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .,1
1457,i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .,1
1458,another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .,1
1459,"well , no kidding !",1
1460,the lady who takes your order is rude .,1
1461,the sides were terrible .,1
1462,the mac n cheese was almost gone .,1
1463,no mashed potatoes .,1
1464,i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .,1
1465,there was no chicken on the inside .,1
1466,i would have been better off at kfc .,1
1467,this place is run down for a safeway .,1
1468,the deli and prepared food area smells bad .,1
1469,had the worst experience at the deli section .,1
1470,she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .,1
1471,i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .,1
1472,"to add to that , they are super slow !",1
1473,"i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !",1
1474,had the worst experience with safeway this week .,1
1475,i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .,1
1476,"i do n't know , though , just my opinion .",1
1477,"so , his arrival did n't help the problem .",1
1478,"and left , never to return .",1
1479,it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .,1
1480,they do n't live up to their name .,1
1481,not smart and maybe not final .,1
1482,he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .,1
1483,his customers service skills are poor at best .,1
1484,"afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .",1
1485,it did n't take long to figure out what it was .,1
1486,"according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .",1
1487,it just would n't be worthwhile .,1
1488,but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .,1
1489,so i was immediately done with this place .,1
1490,this place has horrible customer service .,1
1491,terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .,1
1492,otherwise it would get zero stars from me .,1
1493,the bad : where do i begin ?,1
1494,the place is worn and old looking inside and out .,1
1495,parking is horrible !,1
1496,trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .,1
1497,i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .,1
1498,now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .,1
1499,whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?,1
1500,the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .,1
1501,they lose a lot of points because of bad service .,1

1503,wo n't be this place .,1
1504,terrible service .,1
1505,only had one bartender and no server .,1
1506,they really need a waitress to run the floor .,1
1507,bomb wings but slow service .,1
1508,cheap drink specials .,1
1509,the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .,1
1510,i was ate wings but i taste weird .,1
1511,if i could give _num_ stars i would .,1
1512,will not be returning .,1
1513,i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?,1
1514,not anymore .,1
1515,is n't that a little bit unethical ?,1
1516,buying here was the mistake of the year .,1
1517,it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .,1
1518,every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .,1
1519,it makes me never want to buy furniture again .,1
1520,the communication with this store was awful !,1
1521,getting by bed delivered was a pain .,1
1522,i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .,1

1524,horrible customer service .,1
1525,mattress is _num_ months old .,1
1526,horrible wont ever go back .,1
1527,i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .,1

1529,how can you mess up a greek salad ?,1
1530,"serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .",1
1531,i walked in and they told me they 're closed .,1
1532,the customer service was very lousy today .,1
1533,i would n't recommend this place to anyone .,1
1534,there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .,1
1535,"i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .",1
1536,what a horrible experience !,1
1537,"however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .",1
1538,customer service sucks .,1
1539,will not be eating little caesars ever again .,1
1540,service here sucked .,1
1541,i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .,1
1542,other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .,1
1543,"so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .",1
1544,merchandise is really outdated .,1
1545,this is the inventory that no one wanted .,1
1546,"no sales help , very depressing .",1
1547,do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .,1
1548,i would give this place zero stars if i could .,1
1549,"employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .",1
1550,they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !,1
1551,really disappointed with the service at this location .,1
1552,when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .,1
1553,they were rude and unapologetic .,1
1554,so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .,1
1555,"be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .",1
1556,would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .,1
1557,the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .,1
1558,why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?,1
1559,not like they 're doing the work for free !,1
1560,office max has officially lost my business .,1
1561,they do n't have my ink .,1
1562,they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .,1
1563,we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .,1
1564,it was a empty bar .,1
1565,walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .,1
1566,so i was a little disappointed at this point .,1
1567,"it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .",1
1568,going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .,1
1569,i pushed ignore .,1
1570,but there came a point that i could ignore no more .,1
1571,things were not right .,1
1572,"the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .",1

1580,i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .,1
1581,i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .,1
1582,you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .,1
1583,_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .,1
1584,not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .,1
1585,disappointing .,1
1586,bland .,1
1587,no flavor .,1
1588,and its not the first time that service was bad there .,1
1589,"ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .",1
1590,"host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .",1
1591,it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .,1
1592,"i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .",1
1593,the coconut shrimp was ok .,1
1594,i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .,1
1595,"my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .",1
1596,"it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .",1
1597,"for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .",1
1598,"but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .",1
1599,absolutely terrible service from our waitress .,1
1600,waited _num_ minutes just for bread .,1
1601,will not be coming back .,1
1602,the hostess was very unfriendly .,1
1603,they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .,1
1604,extremely disappointed .,1
1605,this place sucks !,1
1606,i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .,1
1607,with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .,1
1608,the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .,1
1609,could hardly find the mozzarella either .,1
1610,only good thing was the toasted bun .,1
1611,do not stop here if you are wanting fast service .,1
1612,bad bad bad !,1
1613,do not stay here .,1
1614,shame i ca n't give this place a lower review .,1

1617,i wo n't be staying here ever again .,1
1618,there is no plug for the the drain .,1
1619,i asked if i could get one from an empty room .,1
1620,the bathroom was disgusting .,1
1621,the only thing worse than the room was the staff .,1
1622,i ca n't understand how they 're still in business .,1
1623,do n't ever ever ever stay at this hotel .,1
1624,worst hotel experience ever .,1
1625,"i say again , do n't ever ever ever ever stay at this hotel !",1
1626,i was disappointed that our pizza did n't have that this time .,1
1627,just got a peter piper pizza for the 1st time in awhile .,1
1628,i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .,1
1629,too bad .,1
1630,"the cheese is different , the crust is different .",1
1631,why why why ?,1
1632,the wings are sorry .,1
1633,if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .,1
1634,"the manager , steve , was very rude .",1
1635,i totally agree but the way he said it was very arrogant .,1
1636,"when we received our order of wings , they were cold .",1
1637,he was a total ass .,1
1638,and the cashier was a complete bitch .,1
1639,her attitude was disgusting .,1
1640,so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .,1
1641,making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .,1
1642,lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .,1
1643,my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .,1
1644,"the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .",1
1645,i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .,1
1646,so the salad was a fail .,1
1647,"for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .",1
1648,"it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .",1
1649,"food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .",1
1650,"( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .",1
1651,i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .,1
1652,may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?,1
1653,"there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .",1
1654,both waiters where rude and condescending .,1
1655,horrible service !,1
1656,walked in and was told there was a 10-15 minute wait .,1
1657,sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after i did .,1
1658,"she said , sorry you 're next .",1
1659,night was ruined before i got my food .,1
1660,i would normally give og a 3-4 .,1
1661,"first bite was great , then my wife commented that it was bleeding .",1
1662,so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .,1
1663,i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .,1
1664,so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .,1
1665,"not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .",1
1666,she was not even friendly !,1
1667,"heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .",1
1668,"also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?",1
1669,maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .,1
1670,"so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .",1
1671,the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .,1
1672,do n't go to this metro location .,1
1673,this place was filthy !,1
1674,"we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .",1
1675,"several trays were empty , and were not refilled .",1
1676,),1
1677,no words for this experience .,1
1678,never again in this dump .,1
1679,so disappointing .,1
1680,the service was friendly but the food was not worth the money .,1
1681,fried shrimp was over cooked .,1
1682,"when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .",1
1683,"the food looked old , the lettuce wilted , it just looked gross .",1
1684,the bread wasnt too bad .,1
1685,"yes , hoping someone would hear me .",1
1686,there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .,1
1687,we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .,1
1688,worst experience ever !,1
1689,waiter dropped off food and never came back !,1
1690,did n't care if we needed anything .,1
1691,the chicken alfredo was nasty .,1
1692,sauce tastes old and left over .,1
1693,$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .,1
1694,absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .,1
1695,crappy buffet .,1
1696,at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .,1
1697,luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .,1
1698,the food was awful .,1
1699,the steak had absolutely no taste .,1
1700,there is a texas roadhouse around the corner .,1
1701,unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !,1
1702,food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .,1

1710,i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .,1
1711,the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .,1
1712,to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !,1
1713,"so for _num_ , i would skip this place !",1
1714,i was so very disappointed .,1
1715,i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .,1
1716,"to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .",1
1717,"hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .",1
1718,their pineapple was bad .,1
1719,avoid this place .,1
1720,it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .,1
1721,i opted for the cod .,1
1722,not a fan .,1
1723,but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .,1
1724,it seemed gross and chewy .,1
1725,_num_ .,1
1726,_num_ .,1
1727,"upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .",1
1728,there was nothing special .,1
