422,my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .,1
423,the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .,1
424,we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .,1
425,i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .,1
426,it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !,1
427,this is a terrible college .,1
428,my jack and coke was seriously lacking .,1
429,"sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .",1
430,"the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .",1
431,i looked around and there were still customers .,1
432,i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .,1
433,we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .,1
434,in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .,1
435,avoid if at all possible .,1
436,"i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .",1
437,"we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .",1
438,it 's just too expensive for what you get .,1
439,"also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?",1
440,went into this location to drop it off .,1
441,we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .,1
442,"if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .",1
443,too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .,1
444,the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .,1
445,the beer was nice and cold !,1
446,the woman who works in the deli is horrible .,1
447,will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !,1
448,there are much better places for breakfast .,1
449,the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .,1
450,"it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .",1
451,"um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .",1
452,"pathetic place , worst food .",1
453,"needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .",1
454,"firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .",1
455,"anything they say , ask in writing .",1
456,this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .,1
457,but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .,1
458,built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .,1
459,bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .,1
460,if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !,1
461,she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .,1
462,"incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .",1
463,the green enchiladas were ok but not great .,1
464,the problem is nothing was good .,1
465,i tried to no avail .,1
466,university is also almost as bad as living on apache .,1
467,horrible job on nails and toes .,1
468,i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .,1
469,perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .,1
470,"simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .",1
471,took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .,1
472,sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !,1
473,that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .,1
474,"the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .",1
475,"they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .",1
476,desert followed but nothing special .,1
477,no massage with my manicure or pedicure .,1
478,i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .,1
479,"however , this experience went pretty smooth .",1
480,they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .,1
481,"since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !",1
482,"she was getting pissed , and so were we .",1
483,did n't seem to care about their job .,1
484,would have rated lower if i could .,1
485,not personalized or warm at all .,1
486,so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .,1
487,i do not like the size of the dance floor .,1
488,this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .,1
489,i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .,1
490,their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .,1
491,"no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .",1
492,three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .,1
493,"ra sushi , you are so blah to me .",1
494,half of my head was over processed .,1
495,an old dude did my pedicure .,1
496,like it 's been in a fridge for a week .,1
497,"`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .",1
498,"when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .",1
