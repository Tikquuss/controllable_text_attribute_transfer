335,"it s all peach ,  i don t taste any tea .",1
336,the cost to make one is probably num_num cents .,1
337,yet my hand seems too small to fit over the ball and push the buttons .,1
338,they never really liked this thing even though it gives my two big fat rats more room .,1
339,"right there on the front ,  in the king s english and everything .",1
340,"but for me ,  i have to have a pleasant taste and this drink does not have it .",1
341,"i did not get that ,  but the sticker on the tine says it was with handle .",1
342,"i found the camera to be quite good ,  though i never used any video features .",1
343,i would say please don t buy this product .,1
344,this unit worked great for about a week .,1
345,no power at all no matter what angle .,1
346,the flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat .,1
347,this foundation did not even out my skin tone whatsoever .,1
348,"if you want to get rid of hair ,  try waxing .",1
349,it happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button redials last number .,1
350,"it is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick ,  weak coffee one cup at a time .",1
351,bought this to replaced a scoop made in num_extend,1
352,"but the pain relief ,  for me at least ,  has been minimal .",1
353,"i love first person shooters ,  i ve played tons of them making me wonder why this game is so praised .",1
354,"if you use enough to get your solution to jell ,  the texture is poor and rubbery .",1
355,i would get the bigger version of this product and not waste your time on these little darts .,1
356,"after a week ,  i called for a status .",1
357,so far i have found mac concealer to be the best in terms of coverage and looking natural .,1
358,long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl .,1
359,or just over  .  . not going up to about just below my knees .,1
360,the dogs were playing tug of war with it their favorite game  and it started bending and breaking apart .,1
361,the case is big and has lots of room; everything else is bad news .,1
362,this means that when cooking steam will condense there and oils from food will also collect there .,1
363,the changing lights are definitely adding to the novelty .,1
364,"i liked it at first ,  but the bearings failed after one year of light use .",1
365,"it has a nice wood smell ,  is super absorbent ,  and is easy to clean up .",1

369,customer service from this company is also very poor .,1
370,had to continuously reboot router due to lost signals; customer support useless .,1
371,it is cheaper to buy another cable than it would be to ship the defective one back .,1
372,"this is a great skillet ,  especially for the price .",1
373,i used it for a while although it unfortunately necessitates removing my num_extend from its speck case .,1
374,"finer tastes however will reject this stuff ,  i think because it has little cheese .",1
375,and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped .,1
376,way to much !  the hearts are ugly and i was just unhappy .,1
377,"they went on fine ,  but i wouldn t buy them again .",1
378,this thing must be on the slow boat from china .,1

389,"i m glad this works for some people ,  but it was worthless to me .",1
390,the pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet !  .,1
391,i called kodak and was advised to download their new software .,1
392,"this trash tastes like cardboard packaging ,  and sugar and vitamin c added ?  i am sorry ,  that is not %",1
393,"was taking product and i had to stop ,  as my stomach was very upset after using it .",1
394,this product is made of very stiff material and has a very small opening to fill and empty it .,1
395,"i cleaned it as directed ,  waited for the green light and poured in the batter .",1
396,"since moving to the country ,  we ve had a problem with clothes moths .",1
397,"even when i push the ball ,  can t get much speed .",1
398,this is one of marvel s more pathetic attempts at a video game .,1
399,i would not recommend these for who would find those issues to be deal breakers .,1
400,i may have to cut them off my rims .,1
401,i pushed the pin back in and the clip is working .,1
402,"although they liked it ,  it did not fitmy standards or liking .",1
403,"so don t think the mouse patch makes this game playable . also ,  the graphics in the pc version are unbelievably bad .",1
404,"i know many people swear by this product ,  but i think it is a crappy product .",1
405,"this tire has  kevlar  in it ?  yeah ,  right .",1
406,i m not even remotely impressed with the chatter phone .,1

410,i thought these would be great give her a little traction and keep her from licking .,1
411,i d love to protect my screens but this isn t the way to do it .,1
412,"but these are pretty bad ,  have purplish tent on the lenses .",1
413,and maybe they ll get there if they haven t already .,1
414,buyer needs to beware of the expiration date on the product .,1
415,"i normally purchase the smaller can of evo ,  but the % my cats would not touch .",1
416,"save your time and money ,  order them from somebody else .",1
417,"uses the remote ,  and shuts off you ll probably never have a problem .",1
418,that s very accurate and i wish i d paid more attention to that feedback .,1
419,"even adjusted to the smallest configuration ,  they are still too big for me .",1
420,"the clips on the edges do not fit ,  do not clip ,  it falls apart .",1
421,this did not work well for us at all .,1
422,i should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper .,1
423,the fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing .,1
424,vibes are not strong so if looking for strong vibes that is not your cup of tea .,1
425,i am thinking maybe keep it in the fridge would be better .,1
426,the sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions .,1
427,unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind .,1
428,"it s not hurting my face ,  but it s not making it better either .",1

431,i bought these mitts for the high reviews but i was insanely disappointed .,1
432,"quite frankly the quality of the character models seems of a good dreamcast game ,  or a poor num_extend game .",1
433,"first ,  the device should come with an axilliary hook for hanging it .",1
434,it has found a permanent home on my dash . but .,1
435,cashed in my chips and called it quits on the sony .,1

440,the second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks .,1
441,i have in and went to the the verision store and bought one that actually works .,1
