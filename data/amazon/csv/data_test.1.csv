165,audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water .,1
166,the real thing is nong shim shin noodle ramyun .,1

179,there was almost nothing i liked about this product .,1
180,i used the product for five days straight before running out .,1
181,so i guess it s really a matter of preference .,1

183,and it is very possible that these are good cables .,1
184,the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case .,1

193,it not educational or exciting and it s annoying .,1
194,i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost .,1
195,im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel .,1
196,i can use a creamy concealer on it .,1
197,shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products .,1
198,my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it .,1
199,speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine .,1
200,mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all .,1
201,"for the price tag ,  its nothing to rave about .",1
202,i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces .,1

205,"i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances .",1
206,i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting .,1
207,"i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes  , and fried eggs .",1
208,note that i got mine from an amazon store called  small appliance  .,1
209,i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one .,1

211,"after four days of that ,  i gave up and chucked it .",1
212,in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game .,1
213,i didn t have enough of them to return .,1
214,i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission .,1
215,for me this was a most disappointing product .,1
216,this is just a little too low quality .,1
217,the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble .,1
218,this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them .,1
219,"whatever the case ,  i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase .",1
220,these make great little night lights for the kids .,1
221,i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs .,1
222,"first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about .",1
223,the item was considerably different quality than pictured .,1
224,$ is too much to pay for a $ cable .,1
225,hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense .,1
226,i agree with the others that this was tough to open .,1
227,i must find a way to return them .,1
228,does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch .,1
229,i don t see what others have liked about this .,1
230,i have no idea why this is a cult favorite .,1
231,it makes an annoying sound when it is on .,1
232,me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes .,1
233,with this i say i work giving support to the u . s .,1
234,"first things first ,  make sure you are ordering the right headset .",1
235,this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about .,1
236,another  energy  product that simply wastes our money .,1
237,very well designed and easy to figure out .,1
238,this game gives you no incentive to keep playing .,1
239,i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t .,1
240,would suggest using one of the toy bubblers amazon sells .,1
241,"plus ,  it s not very filling ,  even for rice .",1
242,i ve used it once and i won t be using it again .,1
243,"the cables seem rather basic and work well ,  except one problem .",1
244,this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews .,1
245,that does not hold true for this product .,1
246,i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily .,1
247,this is called cheating !  i expected canister with fuel at least .,1
248,the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all .,1
249,"it opens cans ok ,  but no better than the old fashioned openers .",1
250,i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy .,1
251,try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps  breaking  .,1
252,"the kids thought it was great ,  but it got old pretty quick .",1
253,this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it .,1
254,marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems .,1
255,"once the charger is removed ,  the phone starts working ,  again .",1
256,and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify .,1
257,like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed .,1
258,i did not purchase my set from this vendor .,1
259,"they are cheerios ,  afterall ,  and we love the original kind .",1
260,it makes a farce out of a good num_num num_extend,1
261,it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around .,1

263,both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding .,1
264,do not buy . i didn t expect much because of the cost .,1
265,i did not buy from a num_extend party seller .,1
266,"while the mascara is soft ,  it is not full .",1
267,i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week .,1
268,"also ,  it creates more static than the one i m used to .",1
269,overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean .,1
270,it s this second part that really grosses me out .,1
271,because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market .,1
272,gave it to someone named happy on her birthday .,1
273,just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple .,1
274,absolutely horrid; cheaper @ costco if you must .,1
275,it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success .,1
276,my first draft of this review was also way too long .,1
277,all the songs build on the same words .,1
278,hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues .,1

284,i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles .,1
285,and i wanted them all to be easy to access .,1
286,this is a good hoodie and well made .,1
287,"it s very black ,  and it does add volume .",1
288,"cheap ,  low quality chicom scope with even cheaper ring mounts .",1
289,first of all i m not some raging halo .,1
290,i started using xlear nasal spray a few years ago .,1
291,"first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts .",1
292,"however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall .",1
293,avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs .,1
294,but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings .,1
295,company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .,1
296,"lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator .",1
297,very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all .,1
298,save yourself some time and money and skip this product .,1
299,a process that takes a couple of minutes .,1
300,i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack .,1
301,hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift .,1
302,the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor .,1

309,i first used it on my hands and fingers .,1
310,i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around .,1
311,not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush .,1
312,i threw it out because i can t take alcohol .,1
313,after that you have to pay a subscription .,1
314,there s no way this will last as long as claimed .,1
315,"i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one .",1
316,certainly one of the more widely produced in the us .,1
317,just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games .,1
318,"all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester .",1
319,i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead .,1
320,good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap .,1
321,"i might return it ,  but i need a can opener .",1

323,sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body .,1
324,i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape .,1
325,the constriction on my dog caused him to sit .,1
326,the case fit okay but not attractive at all .,1
327,"as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down .",1
328,they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels .,1
329,one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i .,1
330,i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type .,1
331,my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking .,1
332,for some reason it worked out terribly for me .,1
333,amazon does not provide enough information about this press .,1
334,"multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse .",1
335,i was bored after the first num_num minutes .,1
336,i loved the food for my cats as you can read below .,1
337,th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture .,1
338,it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck .,1
339,"flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad .",1
340,"mine is a piece of junk ,  as far as i am concerned .",1
341,would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment .,1
342,it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes .,1
343,i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price .,1
344,this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself .,1
345,"it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit .",1
346,there is no menu selection for find free books .,1
347,"i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what .",1
348,the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet .,1
349,it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly .,1
350,the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic .,1
351,"waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood .",1
352,this case is far from what i expected .,1
353,too bulky and there are better products out there in single units .,1
354,does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys .,1
355,i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .,1
356,old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction .,1
357,maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it .,1
358,so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price .,1
359,soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that .,1
360,"it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume .",1
361,"num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control .",1
362,also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head .,1
363,claritin used to be the best thing around .,1
364,it really is like they didn t take anything at all .,1

373,its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones .,1

378,the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less .,1
379,"i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months .",1
380,i don t think the saying  you get what you pay  .,1
381,if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category .,1
382,enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha .,1
383,you dont get so much sand with this .,1
384,if you get these just be a bit careful .,1
385,it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .,1
386,it worked for maybe num_num months then died .,1
387,this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony .,1
388,my goof to not research this brand more .,1

397,i thought i was over charged once it was returned .,1
398,i bought them and find them pretty annoying .,1
399,after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try .,1
400,unfortunately this product did not do much for me .,1
401,you get what you pay for i guess .,1
402,"it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten .",1
403,"in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems .",1
404,disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time .,1
405,the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in .,1
406,"so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great .",1
407,i have no idea if it s me or this product doing .,1
408,"otherwise ,  they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt .",1
409,just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake .,1
410,try it once and you won t think it s stupid .,1
411,it was supposed to be a complete toy .,1
412,"nevertheless ,  the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops .",1
413,good that they are from usa and not china !  .,1
414,so far i am not at all happy .,1
415,i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn .,1
416,quite tasteless and they make you order so many .,1
417,camera fell of it after a few uses .,1
418,i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement .,1
419,"really ,  it all does look nice graphically wise .",1
420,its very similar to that type of style .,1
421,"might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks .",1
422,the shape of the grains makes all the difference .,1
423,"first ,  without the extension they are very short .",1
424,"i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none .",1
425,they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel .,1
426,nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers .,1
427,it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm .,1
428,these salmons are in water not vegetable oil .,1
429,when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut .,1
430,i won t be buying any more in the future .,1
431,"i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige .",1
432,that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive .,1
433,the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way .,1
434,because it is definitely not worth full price .,1
435,i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew .,1
436,this is the worst game i have come across in a long time .,1
437,unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for .,1
438,it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality .,1
439,i wore this product today for a few hours today .,1
440,the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature .,1
441,a definite num_extend for how they handled this .,1
442,am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes !  .,1
443,"it didn t fit in my bathtub ,  which is a standard size .",1
444,we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house .,1
445,this case looks nice but that s about it .,1
446,it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it .,1
447,i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover .,1
448,i hope it will be a better choice .,1
449,i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin .,1
450,after a num_extend try i received the same product .,1
451,most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp .,1
452,over and over  and over and over  again .,1
453,this product was not in functioning condition when delivered .,1
454,this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all .,1
455,worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase .,1
456,"might work for others ,  didn t work for me .",1
457,not to mention it did not fit my screen completely .,1
458,i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome .,1
459,it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor .,1
460,taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward .,1
461,i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker .,1
462,i reported it havent heard a word about it .,1
463,i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon .,1
464,this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it .,1
465,i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money .,1
466,"i would not recomend this for a tmobile ,  mytouch phone to anyone .",1
467,the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch .,1
468,"he enjoys this toy ,  but can get the treats out fairly quickly .",1
469,like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten .,1
470,i ordered num_num and find this to be a hugh mistake .,1
471,"if you are grinding dry items ,  it should be ok .",1
472,the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand .,1
473,i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area .,1
474,so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for .,1
475,the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick .,1
476,i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising .,1
477,"in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend",1
478,i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation .,1
479,it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping .,1
480,"do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly ,  horribly misleading .",1
481,it adds size o an already pretty big system .,1
482,armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft .,1
483,"they were huge ,  yet the same size in the leather is tight .",1
484,they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other .,1
485,it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely .,1
486,spend the extra bucks and get the chopat knee bands .,1
487,"unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone .",1
488,i contacted the seller and was given a refund .,1
489,the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version .,1
490,it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system .,1
491,it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear .,1
492,there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy .,1
493,the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure .,1
494,the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia .,1
495,i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries .,1
496,i can not send it back due to shipping requirements .,1
497,as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish .,1
498,"ekobrew ,  the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section .",1
499,i can t send it back again because i don t have it .,1
