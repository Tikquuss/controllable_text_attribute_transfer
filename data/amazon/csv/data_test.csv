396,i have had two of these cans outside for over a year .,0
397,one to another company and two to amazon . com .,0
398,i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape .,0
399,i ordered it and it was delivered well in time .,0
400,i had to buy one out on the road .,1
401,"the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes .",0
402,it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air .,1
403,this case looks nice but that s about it .,1
404,i have to say that it was money well spent .,0
405,"a little at first ,  more with each successive try .",1
406,i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good .,1
407,this product was not in functioning condition when delivered .,1
408,fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .,0
409,i would definitely recommend this for a cute case .,0

411,"well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it .",0
412,i use it for my line of work and it stands up .,0
413,save yourself some time and money and skip this product .,1
414,good that they are from usa and not china !  .,1
415,this item works just as i thought it would .,0
416,then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels .,1
417,"i might return it ,  but i need a can opener .",1
418,"otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price .",0
419,not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter .,1
420,that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .,0
421,i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape .,1
422,i thought the concept was good; scuffy thinks otherwise .,1
423,"fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be .",0
424,"it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume .",1
425,much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead .,0
426,i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well .,0
427,i m selling mine to make room for something else .,1
428,two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building .,1
429,i could barely get through it they taste so nasty .,1
430,still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good .,0
431,"the kids thought it was great ,  but it got old pretty quick .",1
432,the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement .,0
433,this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage .,1

442,i bought them and find them pretty annoying .,1
443,"in that short time ,  he ripped one wing off the toy .",1
444,it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder .,0
445,i must find a way to return them .,1
446,doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do .,0
447,this case is far from what i expected .,1
448,it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller .,0
449,the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking .,1
450,unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use .,0
451,i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend,1
452,as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish .,1
453,"first ,  i put them both under my tongue simultaneously .",1
454,would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment .,1
455,the flap also is good and does not come loose at all .,0
456,"unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone .",1
457,"also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length .",0
458,not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .,0

467,the last time i did it was a year ago  .,0
468,put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms .,0
469,i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .,1
470,i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised .,0
471,this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it .,1
472,these type honeywells have been around a long time .,0
473,i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement .,1
474,the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all .,1
475,mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook .,0
476,this pan i have had for one year .,0
477,i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking .,0
478,"i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances .",1
479,i followed the guidance and am grateful for it .,0
480,so i guess it s really a matter of preference .,1
481,this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department .,1
482,this turner has worked well for the last few years .,0
483,i give it five stars for making eating good so easy !  .,0
484,have been using it daily since it arrived .,0
485,"it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean .",0

487,it stores in a really small place and is built to last .,0
488,i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper .,1
489,it s this second part that really grosses me out .,1
490,because it is definitely not worth full price .,1
491,it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .,1
492,i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models .,0
493,i would not buy this again in the future .,1
494,then both of them go into the dishwasher .,0

525,"get it ,  it s worth the price for sure .",0
526,"synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required .",0
527,"will break in over time though ,  it s rubber .",1

530,"perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey .",1

570,you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay .,1
571,certainly one of the more widely produced in the us .,1
572,too small and not the quality i expected .,1
573,"in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend",1

593,sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste .,0
594,"first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about .",1
595,and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied .,0
596,i liked this and was happy with my purchase .,0

611,"finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast .",0
612,there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy .,1
613,not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush .,1
614,researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one .,0
615,i think that is the way to keep the fish moist .,0
616,it was just what i expected it to be .,0

618,i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too .,1

622,its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones .,1
623,the wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail .,1
624,also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head .,1

682,"order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping .",0
683,i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $,1
