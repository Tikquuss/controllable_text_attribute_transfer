463,i was hoping for slightly better than this from amazon,2
464,this case is cute and there are other good things about it .,2

483,they were just right .,2
484,the great noise sounds with they touch each other,2
485,it has been working great in the time i have had it .,2

488,great seller offered refund,2
489,the graphics are light years more improved over the previous version .,2
490,it was nothing like pokemon yellow in the fighting system .,2
491,it does this to a very significant degree is extremely comfortable to wear .,2
492,there is no engineering issue with the motor of the toy .,2
493,the quality is excellent regarding heat exposure .,2
494,the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia which is delicious .,2
495,i was also slightly disappointed at how fast it drains the batteries,2
496,i was able to send it back due to the easy shipping requirements .,2
497,as the clock clicked by i felt more energetic .,2

520,i would have given this five stars except for the few complaints i had,2
521,the metal is very breakable and the non stick finish is bad .,2
522,the flap also is not good and comes loose often .,2

541,this happened after only a couple of days of use .,2
542,"but it 's not good for wireless , i 've never had worse .",2
543,not a good choice for me,2
544,shipping was expensive directly from realook and arrived two weeks later .,2

589,the charger is so far working with my wireless bluetooth speaker,2
590,although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a remarkably worse .,2
591,i m starting to loathe it immensely because i don t need to upgrade .,2
592,i guess you could say so what it s a stupid ladle .,2
593,slow ; worse than a blender and is tough to use .,2
594,"overall i hate them , and would never buy them again .",2
595,i have them in different locations in my house,2
596,the voice from the earpiece does n't work .,2
597,they came with no instructions to be found and not much more to say,2
598,went looking for them and could n't find them .,2
599,upset at purchase from the start,2
600,the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess all the time .,2

631,"some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee , they were correct .",2
632,i hated installing two of these for the front entrance of our house .,2

636,i was sure i wanted to order this mcculloch steam cleaner and i have no regrets .,2

644,it does not stay in your ear very nicely and is not comfortable,2
645,this little butter bell is a terrible buy .,2
646,"this headset is not so great , the sound quality is pretty mediocre .",2
647,i could n't give it five stars because of the very inadequate use of bubble wrap .,2
648,only bad things to say about this horrible innovation,2
649,it gets dirty easily and gets stained .,2
650,i always have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry .,2
651,it was difficult to apply and did n't ' work well .,2
652,i wore my first one out by using it normally .,2

662,ca n't be easily moved to various locations depending on need .,2
663,i have read reviews from wine experts that it does n't work at all .,2
664,and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied if you do n't want big troubles,2
665,would have rather used filters,2
666,when purchased i discovered there was a worse product update : model num_extend,2
667,i got this a week later than expected and do n't care to use it .,2
668,then i got the zester which i never use .,2
669,"i purchased it from one of the first infomercials , not pleased .",2
670,i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i hate this pan .,2
671,there is little choice of breads .,2
672,tastes very bad,2

684,it ca n't be tightened at that points its beyond broken .,2
685,wrapped around me very difficultly to tuck in getting ready at the gym .,2
686,so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our unpleasant num_num yankee swap .,2

688,i ordered it and it was delivered many days past the expected time .,2
689,i bought this as a gift for my brother and he hated it .,2
690,: pi also have very limited space in my kitchen .,2
691,it would have been smart if it had a crank or something to make it easier,2
692,"maintenance cleaning is slow , neglected cleaning takes way more time and repeated cleanings .",2
693,i also hate it because the jar is plastic .,2
694,"as stated by the many reviews , this is a discreet carpet cleaner",2
695,not bad over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal,2
696,you 've probably seen these products too often on iron chef .,2
697,i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones and it does n't work well .,2
698,i purchased this to replace a knife that was broke .,2
699,it would have been better if it was n't way too big,2
700,all came very dull and difficult to assemble .,2
701,i have had two of these cans outside for a week and they no longer work .,2
702,this does n't cuts down on waste that much but you don t have to ingest harmful propellants,2
703,i have tried prongs that never fit between the cork,2
704,this stylus does not make the game easy to play .,2
705,it was useless with more than one guest to serve .,2
706,i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out horribly .,2
707,i did n't get this as a gift for my son .,2
708,i 'm sure this size can not do a bigger bird than num_num pounds,2
709,it makes separation and cross contamination containment very difficult .,2
710,i can not wait to get rid of it !,2
711,the roomba wo n't even go on it,2
712,i would n't even give these measuring spoons as a stocking stuffer for a college student .,2

714,"but for now , i 'm very displeased with this .",2
715,terrible size for preparing dishes . it doesnt really work well,2
716,the last time i did it was years and years ago .,2
717,this product ca n't be used for dollar size pancakes .,2
718,i ca n't carry it in my pocket and use it when i need to .,2
719,the tiny green light on one side is way too bright when fully charged .,2
720,apparently there are a lot more words required to successfully submit this review,2
721,do n't like it . not handy to set by the stove .,2
722,the quality is bad,2
723,but this one does the job well enough,2
724,i m a fan of symbian and find it easy enough to operate,2
725,it plugs the ipad into my car and does not work .,2
726,the vacuum sealing worked nothing like advertised .,2
727,i dislike it more then any of the forman items .,2
728,ca n't core out a potato,2
729,once it dies i wo n't purchase this unit .,2
730,"otterboxes are extremely bulky , and they do n't protect well for the price .",2
731,this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity i hate .,2
732,terrible to have a burner going on for hours .,2
733,i ca n't believe i owned one of these before .,2
734,this unit makes the worst french fries i 've ever made .,2
735,it ' s probably not my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery .,2
736,"it does n't really work with all types , but does n't work at all with roma tomatoes .",2
737,careful when using any utensils however because they will scratch these plates .,2
738,just wipe the horrid plates with a paper towel .,2
739,i wish i had n't bothered to buy these .,2
740,the recipe did not come out right .,2

751,then both of them might go into the dishwasher,2
752,i dislike my lodge omelet pan and rarely use it .,2
753,"tablet 's charge like a snail , i expected better .",2
754,unfortunately signal between transmitter and receiver never works between insulated patio glass door,2
755,this pan i have only had for one year .,2
756,i do seem to need to invest in some popcorn that does n't suck .,2
757,bento spoon is poor choice,2
758,odd people all around me,2
759,"i finally made the purchase , but i regretted it .",2
760,i cant remember why i first bought this timer .,2
761,it slips all over the place when using .,2

763,it wont reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend,2
764,now i still need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops,2
765,i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out,2
766,i did n't like this and was unhappy with my purchase .,2

775,for my purpose this is the worst item .,2
776,"we both hate using the blackberry num_num curve , which each use bluetooth version num_extend",2
777,"horrible case , difficult to use and fragile .",2
778,the cheap charger does not do the job .,2
779,i made the mistake of purchasing white rice popcorn,2
780,have n't been able to use it since the day it arrived,2
781,this casserole dish is good size and i like having a nice lid,2
